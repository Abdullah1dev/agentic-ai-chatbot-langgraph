# 🤖 AI Chatbot with RAG, Human-in-the-Loop & Persistent Memory

An AI-powered chatbot built using **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and **Streamlit** that supports Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), persistent conversation memory, tool calling, streaming responses, and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflows.

The chatbot allows users to upload PDF documents, ask questions about them, maintain multiple conversations, and safely execute sensitive actions through an approval workflow.

# 🧩 Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- LangGraph
- LangChain
- OpenRouter
- SQLite
- FAISS
- HuggingFace Embeddings
- PyPDFLoader

---

# 🚀 Implemented Concepts

## LangGraph

- StateGraph
- Nodes
- Conditional Edges
- ToolNode
- tools_condition
- RunnableConfig
- Checkpointer
- SqliteSaver
- Thread IDs
- Persistent Memory

---

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- PDF Upload
- PDF Parsing
- Document Chunking
- Embeddings
- FAISS Vector Store
- Semantic Retrieval

---

## Tool Calling

- Custom LangGraph Tools
- ToolNode
- Automatic Tool Selection

---

## Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

Implemented a complete approval workflow using:

- interrupt()
- Command(resume=True)
- Command(resume=False)
- InjectedToolArg
- RunnableConfig

The chatbot pauses execution before performing sensitive operations (such as deleting a conversation), waits for user approval, and resumes execution from the exact checkpoint.

---

## Persistent Memory

Conversation history is stored using:

- SQLite
- LangGraph Checkpointer
- Thread-based conversation management

Users can:

- Start multiple conversations
- Resume previous chats
- Delete conversations safely
